# Blinks-tracker
This repository cointains the code to tracks blinks using eye aspect ratio extracted from videos

This repository contains:

1) A notebook showing how to extract EAR from videos and extract blinks-based features with the implemented functions
2) A test file (EAR_test.csv) to test and visualize how blinks-based features are extracted
3) A .py file cointaining all the function needed to extract blinks-based features

When using this code please refer to the following article: "Guglielmo, G., Klincewicz, M., Huis in 't Veld, E., Spronck, P. Tracking Early Differences in Tetris Performance using Eye Aspect Ratio Extracted Blinks. (2023). IEEE Transactions on Games"
